          Originally from Baltimore, MD, I came to Austin to study piano at UT. I graduated with my Bachelor's in Music 
          Performance in Piano in 2019 and went on to obtain my Master's in Piano Performance from Texas State in 2021. 
          I currently teach piano at the Orpheus Academy of Music in Austin, TX.

          Although I received my degrees in music, I've always been interested in technology. 
          I took several coding courses in high school, worked as an audio/visual technician while at UT, 
          and have edited music videos for student projects at Orpheus. 
          My interest in tech led me to the Web Certification program at ACC, where I hope to gain the skills necessary 
          to pursue front end development as a career.
